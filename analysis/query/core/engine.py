        Notes:
        - Division Information:
          * Teams may have division numbers in parentheses, e.g. "Team Name (1)"
          * Division 1 is sometimes referred to as the "C league"
          * Common divisions are 1, 2, and 3
          * Division patterns should be extracted using: REGEXP_EXTRACT(team_name, '\\(([A-Za-z0-9])\\)', 1)

        - NULL Score Handling:
          * Matches with NULL scores are upcoming/future matches that haven't been played yet
          * When calculating win/loss records, only count matches with non-NULL scores
          * For match listing queries, label NULL score matches as "Upcoming" or "Not Played Yet"

        - Date functions available:
          * DATE_TRUNC('month', date): Truncates to start of month
          * DATE_TRUNC('year', date): Truncates to start of year
          * DATE_TRUNC('week', date): Truncates to start of week
          * INTERVAL arithmetic: date + INTERVAL '1 month'

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{table_context}

IMPORTANT CONTEXT AND INSTRUCTIONS:
{division_context}
{team_division_context}
{team_context}
{time_context}

1. DIVISION HANDLING:
- When a query references a division (like "division 3", "league 2", or "C league"), you MUST include filters for both home_team and away_team to include teams from that division.
- Divisions are typically denoted in parentheses at the end of team names like "Team Name (3)" where "3" is the division.
- Use REGEXP_EXTRACT and filtering patterns like this:
  WHERE (REGEXP_EXTRACT(home_team, '\\\\(([A-Za-z0-9])\\\\)', 1) = '[division]' OR REGEXP_EXTRACT(away_team, '\\\\(([A-Za-z0-9])\\\\)', 1) = '[division]')
- Note: "C league" refers to division 1.

2. DATE HANDLING:
- For "current month" or "this month", use a filter like:
  WHERE date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) AND date < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 month'
- Similarly for "current year", "this week", etc.
- ALWAYS include the month filter when a query mentions "this month".

3. TEAM HANDLING:
- When a query mentions a specific team like "Key West", use LIKE pattern matching for both home_team and away_team:
  WHERE (home_team LIKE '%Key West%' OR away_team LIKE '%Key West%')

4. NULL SCORE HANDLING:
- Some matches have NULL scores because they haven't been played yet.
- When calculating win/loss/draw records, treat NULL scores as "upcoming" or "not played" matches.
- Use IS NULL checks to identify upcoming matches: WHERE home_score IS NULL OR away_score IS NULL
- For match result classifications, include a case for upcoming matches:
  CASE
    WHEN home_score IS NULL OR away_score IS NULL THEN 'Upcoming'
    WHEN home_team LIKE '%Team%' AND home_score > away_score THEN 'Win'
    ... (other cases)
  END AS result

5. SQL FORMATTING:
- Ensure the SQL is valid DuckDB syntax
- Always use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with WITH statements to make the query readable
- Always end with a semicolon
- Order results appropriately based on the query (e.g., by points, goals, dates)
- Limit results to a reasonable number (e.g., 10-20) unless specifically asked for more
- Include a LIMIT clause at the end of any query that may return many rows

6. CALCULATIONS:
- For standings or league tables:
  * Calculate matches_played as count of matches with non-NULL scores
  * Calculate wins, draws, and losses based on results
  * Calculate points as 3*wins + 1*draws
  * Calculate goal difference (GD) as (goals_for - goals_against)

YOUR TASK:
1. Translate the following query into a SQL query for DuckDB
2. Focus ONLY on generating the SQL query; do not provide explanations
3. Use clear SQL formatting with line breaks and proper indentation
4. Your response should ONLY contain the SQL query, nothing else
